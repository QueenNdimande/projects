        <div>CONCLUSION
            As an emerging and growing brand we believe that through fashion shows, trade shows and exhibitions our brand, Modesta, can grow. This is where we get a chance to meet new and possible clients, network and make contacts. Most importantly we get to see and learn what other brands in our own sector and businesses in other sectors do and how we can improve our work as a whole.
